Hopping on the wave of new investors in Cryptocurrency without a full grasp of the concept can be dangerous. There is so much to learn about this currency and technology that you should be investing your time in understanding it, even before investing your money 
没有充分掌握加密货币的相关概念就加入到新投资者的浪潮中是很危险的。有很多关于加密货币和技术的事情是你需要在投资之前花时间去理解的。

Pros:

优点

1.Transparency 透明化 
Blockchain is an open ledger that records and monitors all transactions made with Bitcoins, making the cryptocurrency completely transparent. Past transactions can be verified by anyone at anytime. This is part of the reason that it is nearly impossible for any one organization to manipulate the ledger. 
区块链是一个开放式的分布账本来记录和监管所有用比特币完成的交易，这使得加密货币是完全透明的。以往的交易可以在任何时间由任何人来核实，这也是为什么任何一个组织都几乎不可能操控这个分布式账本的原因之一。

2.Inflation is unlikely 不会发生通货膨胀 
There is a finite number of minable Bitcoins in the world. When Bitcoin was created, it was programmed to only have 21 million minable coins. This measure was established to combat inflation. Our traditional currencies are often inflated by excessive printing of new bills. 
世界上比特币的开采数量是有限的。当比特币被创造出来的时候，就被设定其总开采量只有2100万枚。 这种方式被设立出来抑制通货膨胀。我们传统的货币经常因过多印刷的纸钞而产生通货膨胀。

3.Portability 便携性 
Online storage wallets can be accessed from anywhere, making the currency extremely portable. Even Hardware and Mobile storage methods that take up physical space allow you to store any amount of currency on a flash drive or mobile phone. 
网络存储钱包可以在任何地方使用，这使得使用加密货币极其便利。即使是占据物理空间的硬件和移动存储方式也可以让你在闪存驱动或者移动手机上存储任何大量的加密货币。

4.Anonymous transactions 匿名交易 
Organizations and governments cannot trace your transactions. Freedom to buy and sell to anyone in the world without a trace. 
机构和政府无法追踪你的交易。你可以和这个世界上的任何人自由交易 
而不会被追踪。

Cons:

缺点:

1.Lack of public understanding 缺少公众理解 
Although digital currencies like Bitcoin have gained traction in the past few months, there are many who still either have not heard of it or just don’t understand it at all. This causes many of these people to be mistrustful of the technology. Businesses are less likely to accept a currency they do not trust. Also if a business owner does decide to accept cryptocurrency he must then train his staff to understand it. 
虽然像比特币这样的加密货币在过去的几个月已经越来越受欢迎，但是也有许多人要么没有听说过比特币，要么根本不理解它是什么。这就引起了其中许多人对这项技术不信任。企业更不可能接受一种他们不信任的货币。而且，如果一个企业的管理者决定接受加密货币，那么他必须要培训其所有员工来理解它。

2.No recovery of lost money 丢失的钱无法恢复 
Whether you were hacked or forgot your codes, your Bitcoins are not protected like your money in a bank. Once they’re out of your possession they are lost and untraceable. People choose to store their Bitcoins in many ways but even the most secure hardware and paper wallets can be stolen or destroyed. 
不关你遭遇黑客还是忘记密码，你的比特币不会像你放在银行的钱一样被保护起来。 一旦你货币丢失，他们就彻底丢失且无法追踪。人们选择许多方式来存储比特币，但是即使最保险的硬件和电子钱包也会被偷或者被破坏。

3.Subject to market fluctuations 遭受市场波动 
Cryptocurrency is no different than a commodity like oil which is subject to market fluctuations. Any major investment should not be taken lightly and should be researched heavily prior to investment. 
加密货币和像石油一样的商品没有什么不同，都会受到市场波动的影响。我们对于任何主要的投资都不应该掉以轻心，并且在投资前广泛研究。

I hope this helped to give you a sense of the risks and the rewards of investing in cryptocurrency. The payoffs may be grand but cryptocurrency risks make sure its not for the faint of heart. 
我希望这篇文章可以帮助你建立风险意识以及了解加密货币投资的回报。它的收益可能是很客观的但是要确保投资加密货币的风险是自己可以承受的。
