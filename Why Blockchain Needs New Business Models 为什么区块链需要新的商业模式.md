Blockchain has been praised as being the most innovative technological development since the internet itself. Every day, we’re learning new ways how we can integrate blockchain technology into contemporary society, making it easier and safer for businesses to send and receive money across the world. But in spite of all of this, blockchain still faces a huge obstacle in its path: its reputation.
区块链被誉为自互联网时代以来最具革新性的技术发展。我们无时无刻都在学习新的方式将区块链技术融入到当代社会中，让全世界的收款和还款交易变得更加简易和安全。尽管如此，区块链仍然面临着一个巨大障碍——声誉。

Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, and Why Onboarding Investors Is a Challenge

区块链，加密货币，为什么让投资者进入这一领域是一种挑战

Since its inception, the blockchain community has struggled to shake its lawless image. Between 2011 and 2013, Bitcoin was used to buy and sell illegal goods online. And while facilitating illegal transactions is not what Bitcoin was designed for, the uninformed public still associated the world’s first cryptocurrency with the black market.
起初，区块链社区在努力扭转其非法形象。在2011年至2013年期间，比特币被用作在网上买卖非法物品。虽然促进非法交易并不是比特币设计的初衷，但是不了解情况的人们依然把这个世界上的第一个加密货币和黑市交易联系在一起。

The unfortunate truth is that the actions of a few have tarnished the image of cryptocurrency, causing uninformed members of the public to view blockchain technology as dishonest or illegal. Some examples of this that have drawn public attention include:
一个不幸的事实是：一些人的行为损坏了加密货币的形象，这让不了解情况的人们认为区块链技术是骗人的或者违法的。下面一些事例引起了公众的关注：

The Bitconnect Crash: A Ponzi scheme marketed as a lending service, Bitconnect went from being worth $2 billion in market value to a total value of $9,200 as it quietly decided to shut down — wiping out life savings for some investors.
Bitconnect (译者注：比特币投资贷款平台)破产：
Bitconnect被认为是庞氏骗局的借贷平台，当其倒闭时，市值从20亿美金跌到9200美金，这使许多投资者血本无归。

The BTC Global Scam: Nearly 30,000 people, mostly from South Africa, Australia, and the United States, were scammed out of $50 million by scammers pretending to be an investment management company.
比特币全球骗局:大约有3万人，其中大部分来自南非，澳大利亚和美国被自称投资管 理公司的诈骗犯骗取了5千万美金。

ICO Scams: There have even been a few cases of fake businesses taking the time to build legitimate websites, create fake employee profiles, and establish an active presence on the internet, all so they can give the appearance of being a legitimate blockchain project so they can attract investors. After their ICO, they vanish without a trace — taking investors’ money with them.
爱西欧骗局:甚至有一些冒牌企业花费时间来建立合法的网站，创造虚假的员工档案，在互联网上建立一个活跃的形象，这样就可以把他们包装成一个合法的区块链项目，以此来吸引投资者。在爱西欧之后，他们就卷钱走人，消失得无影无踪。

And those are just some of the more publicized scams. There are countless scammers on Twitter, as well as chat apps like Telegram and Twitter, who claim to be blockchain developers who promise you thousands of dollars of free cryptocurrency as long as you send them a small investment of $200 or $300 beforehand.
上述骗局只是众多被公开的骗局中的冰山一角。在Telegram和Twitter这样的聊天软件上，还有无数的诈骗者，他们声称是区块链开发者，并承诺只要你事先给他们200或300美金的小额投资，就可以免费获得数千美金的加密货币。

These scams have become so prominent that Ethereum cofounder, Vitalik Buterin, has addressed the concern on Twitter countless times and has even changed his profile name to “Vitalik ‘Not giving away ETH’ Buterin” as a reminder to people that anyone that the real Vitalik Buterin will never ask for donations in exchange for Ethereum.
这些骗局如此明目张胆，以太坊的联合创始人Vitalik Buterin已经在推特上强调了无数次，甚至把自己的用户名改成了 “Vitalik ‘Not giving away ETH’ Buterin”(Vitalik’不会分发ETH’Buterin)，以此来提醒人们他本人绝对不会向任何人索要钱款来交换ETH。

Cryptocurrency and Volatility 加密货币及波动性

Along with scams and Ponzi schemes, hints of insider trading and market manipulation have scared away many traditional investors who fear the risk of investing in blockchain projects isn’t worth the reward.
随着一起又一起的诈骗和庞氏骗局，内幕交易和市场操纵的迹象让许多传统投资者望而却步，他们害怕投资区块链项目无法获得相应的回报。

Generally speaking, there has always been a higher level of volatility in crypto markets. But with recent talks of cracking down on exchanges in China and South Korea, as well as SEC probes into ICOs in the United States, cryptocurrencies have been especially volatile, with the overall market losing nearly $110-billon in just one day in January.
一般来说，加密货币市场的波动性很大。但是，随着近期中国和韩国严厉打击加密货币交易所以及美国证券交易委员会对于美国境内爱西欧的调查，使得加密货币市场波动剧烈，整个市场在1月份中仅仅一天的时间就蒸发了1100亿美金。

Shifting the Focus from Investors to Entrepreneurs 注意力从投资者转向企业家

The problem with the current business model commonly used in blockchain projects is that it focuses on investors who’re already involved in cryptocurrency. And many of these crypto investors aren’t interested in what these projects can do, but rather how much money they can make buying and selling coins and tokens.
区块链项目中普遍使用现有的商业模式，其问题集中在那些已经参与加密货币的投资者身上。许多投资者对这些项目能做什么并不感兴趣，他们只关心买卖货币和代币可以让他们获得多少利益。

SuchApp believes that the future success of blockchain requires onboarding the people who stand to benefit the most from the various projects. For this reason, they have played a big role in promoting their services to entrepreneurs and traditional business investors that stand to gain the most from its services.
SuchApp （一个多通道消息平台）认为区块链未来的成功需要对那些坚持从各种项目中获得最大利益的人进行知识培训。他们在向企业家和想从他们的服务中获得最大利益的传统商业投资者推广他们服务的过程中起到重要作用。

Exclusive Country-Based Revenue 独有的以国家为基础的收益

One of SuchApp’s most successful strategies targeting investors outside of cryptocurrency has been its Exclusive License Program. This program grants one investor from each country 100% of all platform revenue generated in-country from:

Advertisements.
Group name purchases.
Sponsorship agreements.
4K media.
SuchApp针对加密货币以外的投资者所采用的最成功的策略之一是专属授权计划。这个计划给来自每个国家的一位投资者在这个国家内所有平台产生的全部收入，包括：广告，组名购买，资助协议和4K媒体。

The license runs for a year and can be renewed upon its expiration. Currently, entrepreneurs from all participating African countries and the UK have already been issued exclusive licenses.
这项授权持续一年并且在协议期满时续约。 最近，所有参与项目的非洲国家和英国的企业家已经获得独家授权。

Premium Group Names 优质用户组名

SuchApp’s premium group names allow businesses to establish themselves on the platform. By spending money on a premium group name, businesses have group addresses that are easier for users to access on the SuchApp platform and that aligns with their brand. These groups also allow entrepreneurs to:

Quickly resolve customer service issues.
Create an open channel of communication to their customer base.
Create marketing campaigns and questionnaires.
Broadcast advertisements in the group using videos and text.
SuchApp的优质用户组名可以让企业在平台上建立自己的社区功能组。 通过购买一个优质用户组名，企业会获得与他们品牌匹配的用户组地址，让用户更容易进入到SuchApp平台。这些用户组也可以让企业家快速解决客户服务问题；为客户群创造一个开放式的交流渠道；创建营销活动及调查问卷，用视频和文本的形式在用户群中广播广告。

Empowering Local Businesses Everywhere 授权各地的当地企业

SuchApp values the contributions of local businesses and is committed to creating an online ecosystem that helps businesses around the world reach new levels of success. This is especially true in developing African and Asian countries, where brilliant entrepreneurs weren’t able to expand because of a lack of resources and infrastructure.
SuchApp重视当地企业的贡献，并且致力于创建一个网络生态系统来帮助全世界的企业迈向新的成功。这一点对于发展中的非洲和亚洲国家尤其真实，这些国家中杰出的企业家由于缺乏资源和基础设施而无法扩张。

With SuchApp, entrepreneurs in developing communities are able to use the platform’s advanced communication and marketing services to connect with major economic hubs within their country, as well as bringing their services beyond borders. This allows for up-and-coming entrepreneurs from developing countries to have a greater chance of expanding their customer base both domestically and internationally.
有了SuchApp，发展中国家的企业家们就能够使用这个平台上的先进通讯和市场服务来联系其国内的主要经济枢纽，同时也可以把他们的服务带到国外。这使得发展中国家的新兴企业家们有更好的机会去拓展他们国内外的客户群。

The Bottom Line 本质内容

SuchApp aims to bring value of blockchain technology and apply it in a very real way — by enriching the lives of everyone who uses it. Governments can create an open line of communication to different departments and to citizens, people can use it to connect with their friends and family, and businesses can create in-depth marketing campaigns and facilitate on-platform transactions thanks to SuchApp and blockchain.
SuchApp 旨在带来区块链技术的价值并将其应用到一种非常真实的方式中，即丰富每一位用户的生活。多亏了SuchApp和区块链，政府可以为不同的部门和公民创建一种开放式的交流渠道；人们可以通过它联系朋友和家人；企业可以创建深入的市场宣传、促进平台上的交易。

More than just another blockchain project, SuchApp is committed to fulfilling the needs of entrepreneurs first and cryptocurrency investors second. And by taking that business approach, the company is one step closer to achieving what every blockchain project aims to do: mainstream blockchain adoption.
SuchApp不仅仅是一个区块链项目，它致力于首先满足企业家们的需求，其次是满足加密货币投资者的需求。通过使用此商业方式，公司就更有可能实现每一个区块链项目意图达到的目标——主流区块链应用。

At SuchApp we believe the blockchain community is ready for new, innovative business models that don’t cater only to speculative mindsets. We envision a future where the true benefits of this amazing technology are leveraged to improve the lives of real people all around the globe.
在SuchApp上，我们认为区块链社区已经为一个全新的，革新性的商业模式做好了准备，这种商业模式不需要只是迎合投机心态。我们设想在未来这项了不起的技术能够被用来真正改善全球人民的生活。
