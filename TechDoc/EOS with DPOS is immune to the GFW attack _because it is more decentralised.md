Rumours are continuing to circulate that China is going to regulate all crypto. The rumours include closing down mining and chopping off Bitcoin itself in the great fire wall (GFW) that controls the in/out pipes for the Internet. However, one letter circulated that claims all this appears to be a fake, but it's scared many nonetheless.

谣言正在持续地流传，中国将对所有加密货币进行监管。这些传言包括关闭矿场，并通过“长城防火”(GFW)屏蔽比特币交易，该防火墙控制着互联网的进出通道。然而，有一封信声称这一切看起来都是假的，然而这却让很多人感到害怕。

Can they shut down the mining? Probably, and to much larger extent than the other governments. The reasons are twofold - censorship is a normal part of life there, and the regulations are much stricter, so (1) censorship works. If you couple this to the fact that the mining companies are big and consume a lot of resource, then we can see them as obvious - (2) big hash factories are hard to hide. Therefore, it is fairly likely that an instruction to cease & desist will be taken seriously. And voluntarily. And there won't be any mucking around with secret nets or pigeon IP or ham radio.

他们能关闭矿场吗？可能，而且在很大程度上比其他政府。原因有双方面，——是审查制度是生活中正常的一部分，监管要严格得多，所以审查有效。如果你把这与矿业公司规模庞大、消耗大量资源的事实结合在一起，那么我们就可以把它们看作是显而易见的——(2)大的哈希工厂是很难隐藏的。因此，很有可能会会采取和停止矿场的指令。和自愿。而且也不会有任何秘密的网络或鸽子的IP或业余无线电。

So, the potential attack on Bitcoin and Ethereum is plausible, notwithstanding the likely fake news status of it right now. The ramifications are that about 80% of the mining hashpower would be sliced off, as well as Bitcoin use being isolated within the country. One could even see a potential for Bitcoin to fork into in-country and ex-country chains, something that would align with PRC interests but maybe not with anyone else.

因此，对比特币和Ethereum的潜在攻击是合理的，尽管它现在可能是假新闻。其后果是，大约80%的开采权将被分割，同时比特币在国内也被孤立。人们甚至可以看到，比特币有可能进入国内和国外的两条链，这将与中国的利益相一致，但可能不会与其他国家的利益相一致。

Curiously, and arguably intentionally, DPOS is more or less immune to this attack. The reasons are simply that (a) DPOS is far more decentralised than mining and (b) DPOS responds to the shock of country regulation quickly and without losing any efficacy.

奇怪的是，DPOS或多或少地对这种攻击免疫。原因很简单，(a) DPOS远比POW挖矿更分散，(b) DPOS快速响应国家监管的冲击而不失去任何效用。

Mining is more centralised because the forces of centralisation (or economies of scale) on it are much stronger: Bitcoin and Ethereum mining need huge amounts of electricity. As outlined in an old paper (Güring & Grigg 2011), hashing goes to where the electricity is cheapest. Which currently is in places like Inner Mongolia for various reasons that aren't going away. Further, it's not enough to have a few boxes and great net, you have to be a big warehouse. Which means we know where they all are, and they can't move, easily. Lots of electricity, lots of boxes, lots of money, lots of workers: These are highly centralised installations.

POW挖矿更加中心化,因为它的集中化(或规模经济)的力量更强；比特币和以太挖矿需要大量的电力。正如一张旧报纸(Guring & Grigg 2011)所概述的那样，哈希去了电力最便宜的地方。目前，在内蒙古等地，由于各种原因，这些都不会消失。此外，仅仅拥有几个盒子和大的网络是不够的，你必须是一个大仓库。这意味着我们知道它们都在哪里，而且它们不容易移动。很多电力，很多箱子，很多钱，很多工人，这些都是高度集中的装置。

In contrast, the resources used in DPOS are much lighter. They aren't as subject to local circumstances, and are much more easily moved. Basically, each block producer needs a few big boxes with good net. Which exists in most countries, there are even hobby/volunteer sites like Funkfueur in Vienna that would fit the bill, and many countries deliver real fast net to the home with fibre which would likely be enough for a year or two.

相反，在DPOS中使用的资源要轻得多。他们不受当地环境的影响，更容易被移动。基本上，每个区块的生产者只需要几个大的盒子和良好的网络设施。在大多数国家，甚至有像维也纳的Funkfueur这样的业余爱好/志愿服务网站，这些都符合该法案的要求，而且许多国家光纤到户，这些很可能在一到两年内就足够了。

More, the producers can be re-appointed by the community within the space of a round - approximately a minute. So the moment a large country decides to act, the community can respond as and when it is bothered - by voting to replace the suspect nodes with others ex-country. This can be done on rumour, or we can wait until those nodes drop off, and then repair the network knowing where to repair.

更重要的是，生产者在一个周期内可以由社区重新指定——大约一分钟。因此，当一个大国决定采取行动时，社区就会做出回应，当它受到干扰时——通过投票来取代与其他国家的可疑节点。这可以通过谣言来完成，或者我们可以等到那些节点掉下来，然后修复网络，也知道哪里可以修复。

All this with zero change to the effective block production, and the risk to that production, because there is a ready pool of waiting block producers. Whereas a successful China attack will result in an 80% drop in hashrate around the world and thus the potential for a fork.

所有这些都没有改变有效的区块生产，以及对生产的带来风险，因为有现成的等待区块生产者。然而，成功的中国攻击将导致世界范围内的哈希率下降80%，从而有可能产生一个分叉。


That’s the theory - how do the numbers stack up? If we choose 75% as a suitable indicator of effective decentralisation, we can eyeball the chart (above) and see that 8 mining pools do 75% of all hashing for Bitcoin. Ethereum (below) is even worse at 5!

这是理论——事实数字会如何严重的？如果我们选择75%作为有效去中心化的合适指标，我们就可以看到上面的图表(上面)，看到8个矿池在所有的哈希比特币中占75%。以太(以下)在5点更糟糕!

                                    hashrate - eth - 20170924

Meanwhile, DPOS is mathematical as the blocks are distributed 1 per round across 21 producers, each round, and then shuffled. Then, 75% of 21 producers is … 16, rounded up, as it was with the others.

然而，DPOS是一个数学模型，每轮由21个生产商组成，每一轮分配1个，然后进行重组。然后,75%的21个生产商…16日集合起来,就像其他人。


Hence, DPOS is far more decentralised than either Bitcoin or Ethereum, by a factor of 2 or 3 if the 75% metric is any guide. The fact that there are many thousands of nodes in a Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchain isn't relevant if the chain is dominated by only a small number of pools, and those pools exist in known, accounted-for places vulnerable to a forking attack. Like China. Like 80%.

因此，DPOS比比特币或Ethereum要分散得多，如果75%的标准是任何指南的话，它的分权系数是2或3。如果一个比特币或Ethereum区块链中有成千上万个节点，那么它就不相关了，因为被一小部分的矿池控制，而这些矿池存在于已知的、帐户中——对于那些容易受到攻击的地方来说。像中国。80%左右。
