The debate around POS versus DPOS seems to represent quite a philosophical divide. I have read and listened to various views, some quite strident, polemical. From a technical standpoint I am satisfied that both systems are resilient to attacks, that neither is inherently more vulnerable, that both approaches are viable. So why choose one over the other? While both approaches are viable I think that they would nonetheless produce very different chains.


有关POS与DPOS的讨论看起来像是代表了一个哲学意义上分辨。我阅读并听取了各种各样的观点，有些非常尖锐，像是论战。从技术的角度来看，我觉得这两个系统都有抵御攻击能力，没有哪个一个方法是更脆弱，两种方法都是可行的。那么为什么要进行比较和选择呢？虽然这两种方法都是可行的，但我认为它们会产生非常不同的区块链。

In POS to become a block producer I need to stake a bond and have suitable hardware to run the software. That's it. The implementation then takes over without any more of my involvement. The hardware hurdle is significant. How good does it have to be to run the software? Perhaps systems will be designed that will be able to harness distributed/disparate computing power making for a very decentralized platform. If anyone with even a small stake and a home pc could participate that would be great. But it's a challenging problem. I hope it can be done in a scalable way with low latency and sufficient transaction throughput. I hope that it can be done in a way that can succeed.

对于POS，要成为出块人，需要拥有一个债券，并有合适的硬件来运行软件。如此而已。然后就可以开始运行了，不再需要我更多的参与。硬件投入是主要的。软件运行情况如何？也许系统可以设计为，充分利用分布式计算的一个去中心化平台。这样，即使是小股份和家用电脑都可以参与出块，那将是非常伟大的。但这里有个挑战问题。我希望它能够以可扩展的方式完成，具有低延迟和足够的事务吞吐量。我希望能够找到一种可以成功的方式。

In DPOS block producers are voted in and campaign for the privilege, perhaps offering something more, working harder. More concentrated and powerful hardware that allows the platform to scale is deployed in the service of the community. Steemit has 21 block producers with many more at the ready waiting for your vote, campaigning for your attention. The voting makes the system agile. DPOS can respond to change more easily since change is not always a code change. Change, for some things, is only as far away as a vote. DPOS puts the community centre stage. It asks us to participate, requires us to pay attention. When B1 talks about aligning interests it is human interests that they are talking about, it is human interests that are being aligned. Not just the consensus algorithm's interests. You express your interests with your vote.

对于DPOS，出块人由投票选出，他们需要努力竞选以争取出块权，也许是提供更多的东西，或者工作更加努力。更加集中和强大的硬件，允许平台获得良好扩展性，被部署以服务社区。 Steemit有21个出块者，并有更多的候选出块者等待投票，并努力竞选为吸引你注意。投票使系统更加灵。 DPOS可以跟方便地响应变更，因为变更并不总是代码变更。对某些事情而言，变更像投票一样遥远。 DPOS使社区成为舞台中心。它要求我们积极地参与，要我们投入更多的注意力。当B1谈论协调利益时，正在谈论的是人的利益，是人的利益被调整。不是共识算法的利益。您通过投票表达您的利益。

I'd like to see POS ala ethereum, rchain, cardano etc. go forward. I can't wait to see what happens, to see how they evolve. They might be well suited to some types of applications where human voting is actually not desired. Where humans get in the way. Maybe human voting is fundamentally flawed.


我很希望看到POS应用成果，像ethereum，rchain，cardano等等。我迫不及待想看看会发生什么，看看它们是如何发展的。它们可能非常适合，某些不需要人类投票的应用程序。在某些地方，人本身是一种障碍，人类本身的投票有根本性缺陷。

Or maybe if we can't participate, if we can't co-operate, if we can't be bothered to understand the issues and cast our votes then we are stuffed anyway.

或者我们无法参与，或者我们无法合作，或者我们不能费心去理解问题，那投票就是废物一样无意义了。

POS versus DPOS. An interesting debate! There is fantastic research going on around POS that will undoubtedly lead somewhere. I am certain that important benefits will emerge. But so too with DPOS. I guess that what I am really arguing is that DPOS has certain properties that make it central to the decentralization of politics and governance. It is the only consensus algorithm that is socially disruptive in a good way! The AI apocalypse is less likely under DPOS! BTS and Steemit prove that strong communities can form around DPOS. Of course there is more to be done, but that's up to us. This article by @samupaha talks about how DPOS could evolve to become even more human centric, how it could be even more in the service of and run by us humans. A great post.


POS与DPOS，是一个有趣的讨论！围绕POS已经有不错的研究，这些研究在某些地方引领了应用。我敢肯定，一些重要的成果将会出现。 DPOS也是如此。我想我真正在争论的是，DPOS具有某些属性，使其成为去中心化的政治和治理权力下的核心。它是唯一一种，通过良好的方式进行社会干预的共识方法。基于DPOS， 人工智能接管世界的事情不太可能发生！ BTS和Steemit证明强大的社区可以通过DPOS形成。当然还有很多的事情要做，这取决于我们的努力。 @samupaha的这篇文章谈论了DPOS将如何更加以人为中心进行 发展，，如何能够更多的服务于我们人类，并由我们人类来运行管理。一个很不错的帖子。

At the end of the day we are building these systems for us humans aren't we? Which consensus algorithm do you vote for?

最后，我们正在为我们人类自己构建这些系统，不是吗？ 你投票支持哪种共识算法？

While it will be interesting to see how it all plays out in the years ahead I believe that we need a scalable platform now. ASAP. And notwithstanding some unexpected developments elsewhere I believe that platform is EOS!

虽然看到如何在未来的岁月里展现出来很有趣，但我相信现在，最重要的是我们要尽快的有一个可扩展的平台。尽管可能会有其他一些意想不到的发展，我相信这个平台是EOS！

Am I missing something? Do I have it all wrong?

我是否有些不当之处？ 或者我全错？
